<p style="text-align: center;">ðŸ“¥ Vote for your favorite endangered animal! ðŸ¦¥</p>

Did you know there are over 10,500 critically endangered species? There are so many animals that are close to being wiped off the face of the planet. To bring awareness to this issue RedListVote presents a random set of endangered animals for a daily poll! The most voted animals make their way to the leaderboard. It's a fun and interactive way to learn about endangered animals!
